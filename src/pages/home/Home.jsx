                            <p>
                                In 2016, Uganda suffered from extreme poverty, diseases and the price of 
                                food on the national market increased which got refugees into tears of 
                                hunger, diseases hence having many dead and others left stranded, some 
                                parents committed suicide due to too much stress and failure to feed their 
                                children, many children dropped out of school due to hunger and poverty 
                                hence losing hope for future.

                                We plan to plant eucalyptus trees (forest) in Kyangwali refugee and 
                                host community in order to improve and freshen the air in the area and 
                                also improve on the climate
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                We hope in three years time after planting the trees, they can be used 
                                in construction as poles which can also be used to construct classrooms. 
                                We have secured the land but need seedlings to start the planting. Two 
                                seedlings cost USD1, DONATE A SEEDLING.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project is a multi-purpose because it will help to conserve the 
                                environment as well as supporting in boosting the education for 
                                refugee children, that brings us to the next plan of starting a school 
                                There are only 6 schools in Kyangwali refugee camp which has millions 
                                of children who all need to acquire quality education.
                                You find more than 250 children in a class managed by only one teacher 
                                which is difficult and makes it a need for more schools in the camp. 
                                Planting trees is easiest and cheapest long time project that would 
                                help address the challenge of education in Kyangwali refugee and host 
                                community.
