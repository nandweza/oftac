                            In 2016, Uganda suffered from extreme poverty, diseases and the price of
                            food on the national market increased which got refugees into tears of
                            hunger, diseases hence having many dead and others left stranded, some
                            parents committed suicide due to too much stress and failure to feed their
                            children, many children dropped out of school due to hunger and poverty
                            hence losing hope for future.

                            We plan to plant eucalyptus trees (forest) in Kyangwali refugee and
                            host community in order to improve and freshen the air in the area and
                            also improve on the climate
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            We hope in three years time after planting the trees, they can be used
                            in construction as poles which can also be used to construct classrooms.
                            We have secured the land but need seedlings to start the planting. Two
                            seedlings cost USD 1, DONATE A SEEDLING.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project is a multi-purpose because it will help to conserve the
                            environment as well as supporting in boosting the education for
                            refugee children, that brings us to the next plan of starting a school
                            There are only 6 schools in Kyangwali refugee camp which has millions
                            of children who all need to acquire quality education.
                            You find more than 250 children in a class managed by only one teacher
                            which is difficult and makes it a need for more schools in the camp.
                            Planting trees is easiest and cheapest long time project that would
                            help address the challenge of education in Kyangwali refugee and host
                            community.
